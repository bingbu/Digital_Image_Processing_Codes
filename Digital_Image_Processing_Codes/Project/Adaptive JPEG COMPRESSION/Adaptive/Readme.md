In this Project, I have developed an Adaptive Jpeg Compression Technique, which makes the Quantization Matrix more Optimised. For this project, I have implemented one research paper "An Adaptive JPEG Compression- Encryption System Using Optimized Local Quantization Matrices" of Rimah Y. Bani Youniss, Moh'd Belal Al-Zoubi and Arafat Awajan.
